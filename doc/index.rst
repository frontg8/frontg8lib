|project_name| is a new foundation for `frontg8 <https://frontg8.ch>`_, the
security-centered, opensource communication system. It provides a common
infrastructure for server and client implementations and allows you to
integrate frontg8 in your own project.

To maximize interoperability, libfrontg8 is designed to expose a
straight-forward C API. This allows you to use libfrontg8 from the language of
your choice. Currently we officially support the bare C API and a C++ frontend
for the library. One of our future goals is to provide language bindings for
Python, Java and Rust. If you would like to help out, you can reach us via
`Github <https://github.com/frontg8>`_.
